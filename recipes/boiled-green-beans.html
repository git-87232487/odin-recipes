    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>This super simple green bean recipe is our go-to since it’s lightning fast and is consistently so delicious. 
        It’s also a great texture for kids and adults and can be paired with a whole range of types of meals.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>10-16 ounces green beans</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon unsalted butter or olive oil</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>0.50 oz ginger</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
       <li>Wash your green beans. Break off the ends and any brown parts. Break in half if very long.</li>
       <li>Bring a medium pot of water to a boil over high heat, then reduce to a simmer over medium-high heat. Add the beans and simmer for 4-6 minutes or until tender when poked with a fork.</li>
       <li>Drain the water from the beans, then add butter or olive oil, and season to taste with salt. (I usually just add a little sprinkle.)</li>
    </ol>
