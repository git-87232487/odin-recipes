    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>If there’s one vegetable that’s always a winner in our house: it’s broccoli. No matter how it’s cooked, it disappears quickly! (It’s probably the quickest with roasted broccoli, as it has the addictive power of french fries.) Alex and I were looking for a new method for broccoli and guess what? You can boil it, too. Boiled broccoli comes out
         perfectly bright green and crisp tender after just 2 minutes in hot water. Here’s exactly how to make it!</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 1/2 pounds (2 large heads) broccoli</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon lemon juice</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon kosher salt</li>
        <li>Fresh ground black pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
       <li>Chop the broccoli into florets.</li>
       <li>Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Add the broccoli florets and boil them for 2 ½ to 3 minutes until bright green and crisp tender, 
           taste testing often (basically, don’t leave the pot!). Once they’re cooked, drain into a colander.</li>
       <li>Place in the serving dish 
           and stir in the olive oil, lemon juice, and kosher salt. Taste and add additional seasoning to taste.</li>
    </ol>
